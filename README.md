# regex-game

A multiple choice game of speed... with regex.  There are words attempting to rain down destruction on the city and it is your mission to prevent that from happening.  There are three buttons with regular expressions on them and it is your job to select the regular expression that matches one or more of the words raining down.  But don't take too long to make your choice, because each word that reaches the grounds of the city increases the damage to it, first casting it in progressive levels of red before taking away more and more of the city's skyline.  Can you save the city?
